Run 3 TIPS
With all of the levels and characters in Run 3, it can get overwhelming while playing. Check out a few tips to help you succeed right off the bat.

New aliens, new tricks
There are 9 characters you can unlock as you play through the levels. If you save up enough power cells, you can unlock new characters right away! Each alien has their own set of skills that will help you navigate the galaxy. If you find yourself stuck in a tricky tunnel, try swapping out your character for a new one. For example, the Skater will perform better in the snow levels!

Control your jumps
The longer you hold down the up arrow key, the higher and longer you’ll jump. For platforms with a small gap in between, try tapping the up arrow to make a small jump. This technique can help you avoid overshooting your landing.

Look ahead
Put your focus on the platforms just ahead of your character. Take note of all the different sides of the tunnel to plan your next jumps. This should help you determine which way to turn the tunnels so that your character has plenty of space to run.

Infinite practice
Infinite Mode is great for collecting power cells to unlock characters, but it can also be great for practice too! If you’re stuck on a level on the galaxy map, try a few runs through the infinite tunnels. The tunnels won’t be the same every time, so you’ll get a good feel for the different obstacles.
